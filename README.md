# About

### Introduction
KPIM Corporation is a bike manufacturing company which sells bikes through 2 main channels: an Online Store for Individual Customer and through Distributor for other Sales Contacts.

### Data
The data includes all orders booked by two main customer types in 2014: IN for individual customers and CS for sales contacts. Information you can use to analyze includes product hierarchy, territory, sales program, different time periods (order, ship, due date) and the Line Total is the actual Revenue received for that order. 

### Proposal
- Used Excel to create a dashboard including charts, graphs, and tables that can be easily updated by using pivot tables and adding new data to identify sales   metrics for the sales team
- Revenue this month compared to last month and growth Rate
- Revenue each month of this year and the month-over-month growth rate
- Ratio between two types of customers and the growth rate of each type
- Revenue for each product category/sub-category/product this month compared to last month and the growth rate
